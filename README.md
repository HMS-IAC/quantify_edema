# How separated are cells in tissue? 
This tutorial teaches how to quantify the extent of cell-cell separation in histopathology tissue. 
Examples shown are on cell-cell separation of inflammed and healthy H&E slices of mouse pancreases.  
This tutorial requires basic familiarity with python, and familiarity with python environments and dependencies.  


## It follows these steps: 
- [Quality control](./0_Quality_ctrl.ipynb)  
- [Segment tissue (forground vs background)](./1_Segment_tissue.ipynb)  
- [Segment gaps between cells in the foreground region](./2_Segment_gaps.ipynb)   
- [Export segmentation masks from QuPath](./3_Export_segmentation.ipynb)  
- [Tile output images](./4_Tile_images.ipynb)  
- [Count and export the density of branchpoints](./5_Count_branchpoints.ipynb)
